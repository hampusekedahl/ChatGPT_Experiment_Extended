Solve this programming problem as runtime and memory effecient as you can with C++ "Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 0
Example 2:

Input: s = "loveleetcode"
Output: 2
Example 3:

Input: s = "aabb"
Output: -1
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of only lowercase English letters.". This is the code starting template "class Solution {
public:
    int firstUniqChar(string s) {
        
    }
};".
