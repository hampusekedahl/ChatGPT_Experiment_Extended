Solve this programming problem as runtime and memory effecient as you can with Java "Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', return the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses 
substring
.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "(()"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()".
Example 2:

Input: s = ")()())"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()()".
Example 3:

Input: s = ""
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 3 * 104
s[i] is '(', or ')'.". This is the code starting template "class Solution {
    public int longestValidParentheses(String s) {
        
    }
}".
