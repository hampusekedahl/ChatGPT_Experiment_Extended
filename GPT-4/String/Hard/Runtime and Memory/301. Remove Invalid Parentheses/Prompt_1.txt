Solve this programming problem as runtime and memory effecient as you can with C++ "Given a string s that contains parentheses and letters, remove the minimum number of invalid parentheses to make the input string valid.

Return a list of unique strings that are valid with the minimum number of removals. You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "()())()"
Output: ["(())()","()()()"]
Example 2:

Input: s = "(a)())()"
Output: ["(a())()","(a)()()"]
Example 3:

Input: s = ")("
Output: [""]
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 25
s consists of lowercase English letters and parentheses '(' and ')'.
There will be at most 20 parentheses in s.". This is the code starting template "class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> removeInvalidParentheses(string s) {
        
    }
};".
