Solve this programming problem as runtime and memory efficient as you can with Java "Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target, return the minimal length of a 
subarray
 whose sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.

 

Example 1:

Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
Example 2:

Input: target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: target = 11, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

1 <= target <= 109
1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 104". This is the code starting template "LeetCode Logo
